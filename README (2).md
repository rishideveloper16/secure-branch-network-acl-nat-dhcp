# Office Network Design & Configuration

## Description
Designed a small-scale office network using Cisco Packet Tracer with VLAN configuration, IP subnetting, and inter-VLAN routing.

## Features
- Created a network for 3 departments (Admin, Sales, IT) with separate VLANs
- Assigned IP addresses using subnetting for efficient network utilization
- Configured routers and switches for communication between VLANs
- Verified connectivity using ping tests

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Steps to Run
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review VLAN configurations on switches.
3. Run `ping` tests between PCs from different VLANs to verify routing.

## Output Example
- Successful pings between VLANs after router-on-a-stick configuration.
